This is a fork of a small subset of [Alex Robenko's `embxx` library](https://github.com/arobenko/embxx) which provides a static queue.

This subset was relicensed from GPLv3 to MIT with explicit permission from the author.
(See [StaticQueue.h](StaticQueue.h) and [SizeToType.h](SizeToType.h)

See the [commits](https://github.com/citybound/static-queue/commits/master) for additional modifications by Anselm Eickhoff;
